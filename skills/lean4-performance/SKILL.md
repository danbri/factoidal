description: Improve performance-sensitive Lean 4 code in Factoidal while preserving total semantics, observable order, and executable proof boundaries. Use for large parser, RDF/block ingestion, data-structure, recursion, or hot-path work; not for unmeasured micro-optimisation.

# Lean 4 performance in Factoidal

Start with a concrete phase and an observable baseline: text read, parse,
bucket/index build, block encode/decode, range I/O, query evaluation, or result
formatting. A green semantic test is not a throughput result, and a fast host
shim is not a semantic replacement.

## Recursion and collection rules

- In a repeatedly invoked path, treat `xs.length`, `List.reverse`, `++`, and
  `String.toList` as costs to account for. `remaining.length` used to choose
  fuel inside every parser step is often an accidental quadratic scan.
- Build ordered lists with a reverse accumulator and restore order exactly once
  at a named boundary. State the preserved order in the doc comment and test
  it where it affects RDF/SPARQL results.
- Make a scanner tail-recursive when it consumes a flat stream and only needs
  a token/result accumulator. A reverse accumulator is normally the right
  representation.
- Keep structurally recursive or fuelled recursion for grammar nesting and
  semantic tree traversal when it supports totality or proofs. Do not replace
  it with `partial` merely to obtain a loop-like shape.
- A recursive map over a small, bounded metadata list may be appropriate. Do
  not generalise that exception to data-sized lists, graph rows, or tokens.

## Input-proportional recursion is a stack bug, and the scanner is the gate

A function that recurses once per element of an input the CALLER sizes -- a
list, a string, a byte stream, a declared entry count -- costs one C stack
frame per element. On the host that is a slow path; in the wasm module it is a
crash, because the stack we ship there is far smaller. The rule:

> **Recursion over an input-proportional structure is tail-recursive or
> worklist-driven. Never rely on a bigger stack.**

### How to tell, by tool and not by reading

Lean compiles a DIRECT TAIL self-call into a jump: the emitted C function opens
with `_start:` and the call becomes `goto _start;`. Any self-call that survives
as a real C call is a real stack frame. Read that from the compiled output:

    lake build                                   # in formal/lean4/
    python3 tools/lean-tail-recursion-audit.py   # counts, areas, ranked table
    python3 tools/lean-tail-recursion-audit.py --json /tmp/t.json
    python3 tools/lean-tail-recursion-audit.py --gate   # CI form

`--gate` fails when a NEW input-proportional recursion appears that is not in
`tools/lean-tail-recursion-allow.txt`. Removing a line from that file is the
goal; adding one needs a reason in the commit message. Read the script's
docstring for what the method cannot see -- inlining, specialisation, and
recursion that runs through an unspecialised core combinator.

The first measurement, 2026-09-07: 833 self-recursions without a loop, 268
mutual cycles; 598 input-length, 42 input-depth. Per area (length): JSON-LD 71,
Shardborough 66, SPARQL 65, SHACL/ShEx 36, OWL 33, RDF parsers 18, XPath/XSLT
18, XML 11.

### The repair: `csimp`, not a rewrite of the specification

Keep the specification's shape -- every theorem is stated about it -- and add a
tail-recursive twin plus a proved `@[csimp]` replacement. The code generator
then emits the twin and the proofs are untouched. `csimp` replaces one CONSTANT
by another, so the accumulator's empty start needs its own `def`:

```lean
def decodeEntriesTR (version : Nat) : Nat -> List UInt8 -> List Entry ->
    Option (List Entry × List UInt8)
  | 0, bytes, acc => some (acc.reverse, bytes)
  | n + 1, bytes, acc =>
      match decodeEntry version bytes with
      | none => none
      | some (entry, after) => decodeEntriesTR version n after (entry :: acc)

theorem decodeEntriesTR_eq (version : Nat) : ∀ n bytes acc,
    decodeEntriesTR version n bytes acc =
      (decodeEntries version n bytes).map (fun p => (acc.reverse ++ p.1, p.2)) := ...

def decodeEntriesImpl (version n : Nat) (bytes : List UInt8) := decodeEntriesTR version n bytes []

@[csimp] theorem decodeEntries_eq_decodeEntriesImpl :
    @decodeEntries = @decodeEntriesImpl := ...
```

`@[implemented_by]` reaches the same runtime effect with no proof. It is an
unchecked assumption about the two functions agreeing, and this tree does not
take those. Use `csimp`.

### What it cost

* <https://github.com/danbri/factoidal/issues/670>. `ShardManifest.decodeEntries`
  recursed once per manifest entry. The published SKOS manifest declares 36,106,
  so a browser tab answered "Maximum call stack size exceeded", and
  `storeQueryPlan` never returned.
* <https://github.com/danbri/factoidal/issues/673>. Recorded as "XML entity
  expansion is not tail-recursive, near 2,000 sequential entities". The scanner
  plus a bisection said otherwise: `expandEntityValue` was already loop-compiled
  except for its nested-entity dive, and the ceiling tracked DOCUMENT LENGTH,
  not entity count. 500 plain sibling elements and 12,000 characters of ordinary
  text both died, with no entity present. The recursion was
  `normalizeLineEndings`, the section 2.11 line-ending pre-pass, which walks
  every character of the document before parsing starts. The wasm RDF/XML
  parser's ceiling was about 7,000 characters of any input.
* The 36,106-entry manifest took 322 s natively. That number did NOT come from
  the recursion: `/usr/bin/sample` put every sampled frame in
  `ShardManifest.valid` -> `uniqueArtifactKeys` -> `List.eraseDupsBy`, a
  quadratic duplicate scan over about 150,000 artifact keys. Measure before
  attributing a cost to the defect you happen to be holding.

`tests/stack/run.sh` is the behavioural half of this: deep inputs on two
routes, the committed wasm module in Node and the native CLI. Add a case there
whenever you repair one of these.

## Factoidal RDF/block ingestion

The parsing layers and their entry points are recorded in
[`docs/designissues/2026-09-03-rdf-parsing-strategy.md`](../../docs/designissues/2026-09-03-rdf-parsing-strategy.md);
read it before changing a parser path.

`L4Factoidal/Syntax/Turtle.lean` preserves source triple order. Its statement
parser and flat name/whitespace scanners use append-free/tail-recursive paths;
retain that order contract when changing them. `parseTurtleFold` lets a packer
consume completed statements without materialising a second source `Graph`,
but it still starts from a complete `String` and character list. Treat genuine
byte-chunk input as the next separate design step: it must carry Turtle prefix,
base-IRI, RDF-mode and blank-node state across chunks. Never split Turtle on
newlines.

`Storage/PredicateBlocks.lean` keeps per-predicate rows in reverse buckets
while ingesting, then restores source order before creating an `IndexedBlock`.
The packer may avoid a duplicate graph, but the current one-block-per-predicate
format still retains each predicate's rows until its immutable block is built.
Do not claim streaming-scale memory until bounded block publication exists.

`Syntax/TurtleStatementScan.lean` is the chunk-stable candidate scanner the
packer runs per character. Any per-character or per-line decision in it must
read O(1) state, never the accumulated candidate. Paid for 2026-09-02: the
no-dot directive test reversed the whole current candidate at every line end
(`dropWs currentRev.reverse`), O(lines × characters) per statement group,
which turned a 134 MB polygon group (4,211 lines) into 334 s of packing and
the UK Parliament dump into 6,134 s. The fix keeps a seven-character `head`
maintained by `pushHead` and proves it equal to the old form
(`TurtleStatementScanTheorems.head_eq_spec`). How it was found: a size
ladder of slices without large literals was linear (34 µs per triple), so
the cost was isolated to the large-literal region and that region packed
alone; do that before reading code for a superlinear ingest.

## Verification and measurement

After a semantic hot-path change, run the closest Lean guards and targeted
executable path, then the persistent block smoke when ingestion or block bytes
are affected:

```text
cd formal/lean4 && lake build L4Factoidal.Syntax.TurtleTests l4block-shard-pack
cd ../.. && tools/blockengine-shard-merkle-scan-smoke.sh
```

Use a bounded real corpus in addition to fixtures. Record input identity,
triple count, elapsed time, output bytes, host and what is *not* measured in a
dated worknote. Stop or cap long experiments deliberately; do not leave
duplicate background packers competing for the same temporary output.

For the current KGX scale observations and the required future byte-streaming
ingest boundary, read [`docs/20260830-ibk2-ingest-scale.md`](../../docs/20260830-ibk2-ingest-scale.md).
