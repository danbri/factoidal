# L4Factoidal — F\* → Lean 4 port notes

Scope of this stage (goal steps 1–3, 2026-08-22): the RDF term/graph
data model, the SPARQL algebra core (solution mappings, triple
patterns, BGP evaluation, §18.5 operators), and proved invariants.
Everything builds with `lake build` on the pinned toolchain
(`lean-toolchain`: Lean 4.33.1); the `#guard` tests in
`L4Factoidal/Tests.lean` run at build time, so a green build is also
a green test run.

## Module correspondence

| Lean 4 | Ports (F\*) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `L4Factoidal/RDF/Core.lean` | `RDF.Term.fsti`, `RDF.Triple.fsti` | terms, literals (incl. RDF 1.2 direction + triple terms), the three literal-equality relations, reflexivity/identity theorems |
| `L4Factoidal/RDF/XmlCanon.lean` | `RDF.Term.fsti` `xmlc_*` family | rdf:XMLLiteral exclusive-c14n value equality (WebOnt-miscellaneous-202 fix) |
| `L4Factoidal/RDF/Graph.lean` | `RDF.Graph.fsti` (+ `RDF.Dataset.Merge` renaming) | graphs as lists with set-semantics ops, datasets, blank-node renaming, membership theorems |
| `L4Factoidal/SPARQL/Algebra.lean` | `SPARQL11.Algebra.fst` Parts 1–2, §7.2–7.3/§18.5 | bindings, patterns (incl. SPARQL 1.2 triple-term patterns), `tpMatch`, `evalBgp`, join/leftJoin/union/minus/filter, `GraphPattern.eval` |
| `L4Factoidal/SPARQL/Invariants.lean` | (new; replaces the F\* SMT-`Lemma` style) | empty-pattern laws, merge/lookup characterisation, filter/minus safety, BGP monotonicity — all kernel-checked, no solver |
| `L4Factoidal/SPARQL/Expr.lean` | `SPARQL11.Algebra.fst` Part 3 + §17: `expr`, `comp_op`, `arith_op`, `aggregate_fn`, `eval_result`, `ebv_checked`, `bool_and/or/not_checked`, `er_to_term`/`er_to_string`/`er_string_info`/`er_direction`/`er_string_preserve`, the scaled-decimal numeric model (`parse_to_scaled`, `parse_double_to_scaled`, `format_scaled_value`, `format_as_double`, `add_scaled`, `numeric_compare`, `value_compare`, `format_numeric_result`, `eval_arith_int`), the `fn_*` accessor family, `fn_langMatches_spec`, and the `eval_expr_with_base` / `eval_coalesce_with_base` / `eval_in_with_base` / `eval_concat_with_base` clique | the §17 expression language: AST, effective boolean value, promoted numeric types, the §17.3 error tables, §17.4 builtins, and `Expr.toCond` — the §18.5 bridge that finally gives `GraphPattern.filter` a real filter |
| `L4Factoidal/SPARQL/ExprTheorems.lean` | (new; replaces the F\* SMT-`Lemma` style) | §17.2.2 EBV rows, §17.4.1.1 BOUND, the §17.3 truth tables at both the `Option Bool` and evaluator level, the scaled-decimal order (reflexivity, exchange/antisymmetry, cross-multiplied characterisation, transitivity), `=` reflexivity on IRI/literal/Boolean/numeric values and its non-reflexivity on blank nodes, and the §18.5 FILTER collapse |
| `L4Factoidal/SPARQL/ExprTests.lean` | (new) | 152 `#guard` checks over the §17 semantics plus the FILTER/LeftJoin bridge on the `Tests.lean` fixture. NOT a conformance score: no parser, no manifest reader — iron rule #6 is met only when a Lean runner reads the W3C files |

## Translation decisions

- **Refinements → subtypes.** `wf_iri = s:iri{is_iri s}` becomes
  `WfIri := {s : String // isIri s}`; the F\* `assert_norm` witnesses
  for constants become `rfl` proofs the kernel evaluates.
- **`literal_term_eq` collapses into `DecidableEq`.** The F\* strict
  term equality is field-by-field; in Lean that IS propositional
  equality (`Literal.termEq_iff_eq` proves the F\*
  `lemma_literal_term_eq_identity` counterpart). The COARSER engine
  equality (`Literal.eqb`: case-folded language tags, XMLLiteral
  c14n) stays a separate Bool relation, exactly as the F\* source
  warns it must.
- **Spec/engine decoupling.** The port keeps the SPECIFICATION
  evaluator: list scans, left-to-right BGP extension, nested-loop
  join. The F\* engine's index seam (`graph_store`/`RDF.Indexed`),
  selectivity planner (`choose_best_tp`), keyed hash join, fuel
  bounds, and tail-recursion (`*_tr`) rewrites are performance
  machinery over this same semantics and are deliberately not ported.
- **Filter conditions are `Binding → Bool`** in `Algebra.lean`. The
  expression stage (`Expr.lean`) supplies the real thing through
  `Expr.toCond : Expr → Binding → Bool` and the wrappers
  `GraphPattern.filterExpr` / `GraphPattern.leftJoinExpr`, so
  `Algebra.lean` never had to change. §18.5's "effective boolean value
  of true" is where a type error and `false` become
  indistinguishable — the collapse is in `toCond`, not in `ebv`.
- **`assume val` → PARAMETER.** What the F\* evaluator reaches for
  through the host (`fx_current_datetime`, `extension_function_call`)
  becomes a field of `EvalEnv`: `now`, `ext`, and `existsHook` for the
  §18.6 pattern layer. With `emptyEnv` each is absent and the operator
  is a type error — which for §17.6 extension functions is exactly the
  spec's own answer, not a shortcut.
- **`literalWf` is paid once.** Every literal an operator builds needs
  its well-formedness proof, so `Expr.lean` funnels construction
  through `mkTypedLiteral` / `mkLangLiteral` / `mkDirLangLiteral`
  (each discharging `literalWf` by kernel computation). The F\* source
  builds bare records and lets Z3 discharge the refinement at every
  site.
- **No `/` on `Int`.** The port uses an explicit truncate-toward-zero
  `intDivT`, because the rounding direction of Lean's `/` on `Int` is
  the one place where it could silently disagree with F\*'s
  `op_Division` and its OCaml extraction.
- **Fuel instead of well-founded recursion for `countDigits`.** The F\*
  `count_digits` recurses on `n / 10`; the Lean port carries an
  explicit fuel argument so the function stays STRUCTURAL and `#guard`
  can evaluate it during elaboration.
- **Deviations from the F\* semantics, stated plainly:**
  - `IRI()`/`URI()` does not resolve a relative reference against the
    query BASE (the F\* `resolve_iri`); RFC 3986 reference resolution
    is not ported, so a non-absolute lexical form is an error.
  - TIMEZONE, TZ, REGEX, REPLACE, the five hash builtins, aggregates,
    and EXISTS-without-a-hook return `EvalResult.error` — the
    constructor-level type error, never `sorry`. Each is listed with
    its reason in the `Expr.lean` module banner.
  - Argument LISTS (COALESCE, IN, CONCAT, function calls) are
    evaluated eagerly rather than short-circuited. The evaluator is
    pure and total, so this is observationally identical; it is noted
    because it is a visible difference from the F\* recursion shape.
- **No SMT scaffolding.** `SMTPat` hints, Z3 fuel pragmas, and
  helper lemmas whose only job was guiding the solver have no Lean
  counterpart — proofs are explicit tactic scripts. Axiom audit
  (`#print axioms`, in the build log): only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` — Lean's standard foundations; no
  `sorry`, no user axioms, no `native_decide`.

## Assumption report — `assume val`s in the F\* originals

Requested by the port brief: unverified assumptions encountered in
the source modules.

- `RDF.Term`, `RDF.Triple`, `RDF.Graph`: **zero** `assume val`s. The
  core data model is fully defined; nothing was assumed away, and the
  port confirms it (every ported definition is total and executable).
- `SPARQL11.Algebra.fst`: **10** `assume val`s, all host-boundary
  call-outs (rule #11 of the F\* tree's own policy), none of them in
  the fragment this stage ports:
  - `string_uppercase_unicode` / `string_lowercase_unicode` —
    Unicode case mapping (host library). Lean note: `String.toLower`
    is used for language-tag folding; BCP47 tags are ASCII, so this
    is exact where the F\* tree needed the host for full Unicode.
  - `hash_md5` / `hash_sha1` / `hash_sha256` / `hash_sha384` /
    `hash_sha512` — SPARQL §17.4.4 hash builtins (vendored crypto).
  - `fx_current_datetime` — `NOW()` (clock I/O).
  - `extension_function_call` — SPARQL §17.6 extension-function host
    registry (issue #463).
  - `eval_property_path_fwd` — a forward reference into the
    property-path evaluator (an F\* module-structure artifact, not a
    semantic hole; the evaluator is defined later in the same file).
  - `service_endpoint_lookup` — SERVICE endpoint resolver (issue
    #57; the federated-query host seam).

  A Lean continuation porting the expression language will need
  positions for the first three groups (pure Lean implementations are
  feasible for all of them: Unicode tables, vendored hash cores, and
  a clock parameter instead of an ambient call).

### Assumptions met by the expression-language stage (`Expr.lean`)

The §17 fragment ported here meets four of those ten `assume val`s.
None of them became a Lean `axiom`, an `opaque`, or a `partial def`:

| F\* `assume val` | Where it bites in §17 | What `Expr.lean` does instead |
|---|---|---|
| `string_uppercase_unicode` / `string_lowercase_unicode` (issue #250) | UCASE / LCASE (§17.4.3.4/5) and the case-insensitive language-tag folding in langMatches and CONCAT | Uses Lean's own `String.toUpper` / `String.toLower`. **Stated precisely:** these are ASCII case mappings, so they are EXACT for BCP 47 language tags (ASCII by construction) but INCOMPLETE for UCASE/LCASE on non-ASCII text — the same gap issue #250 tracks on the F\* side, with the same shape (`"Müller"` upper-cases to `"MüLLER"`). A full Unicode case-mapping table is a separate pure-Lean port. |
| `hash_md5` / `hash_sha1` / `hash_sha256` / `hash_sha384` / `hash_sha512` (§17.4.3.16) | MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 | NOT implemented and NOT assumed: the five constructors return the constructor-level type error. A pure Lean implementation, provable against a spec, is the intended answer; a stub that returns a plausible-looking string would be worse than an error. |
| `fx_current_datetime` (§17.4.5.1, issue #287) | NOW() | Became the input `EvalEnv.now : Option String`. The clock read moves to the executable edge; the semantics is a total function of its arguments. With no timestamp supplied, NOW() is a type error. |
| `extension_function_call` (§17.6, issue #463) | any IRI-named function no native family claims | Became the input `EvalEnv.ext : String → List EvalResult → Option EvalResult`. The default (`none` for every IRI) makes an unregistered IRI a type error, which is what §17.6 requires. |

The remaining F\* `assume val`s in this region belong to features the
stage does not port: `regex_match` / `regex_replace` (REGEX, REPLACE),
`eval_property_path_fwd`, and `service_endpoint_lookup`.

## Findings from the expression-language stage

Two behaviours the port made visible. Both are recorded as `#guard`s in
`ExprTests.lean` so they cannot drift silently, and neither is asserted
to be correct:

1. **Only a VARIABLE lookup promotes a literal.** `literalPromote`
   runs on the `E_Var` arm; `E_Literal` returns the term as written.
   So `"1"^^xsd:integer = "01"^^xsd:integer` written literally in an
   expression compares LEXICALLY and answers `false`, while the same
   comparison through two bound variables answers `true`. Faithful to
   the F\* source; SPARQL 1.1 §17.1's operand mapping would say `true`
   in both cases.
2. **STRDT's result is not promoted either.** `STRDT(STR(?a),
   xsd:integer) > 18` is a type error and drops the row, because
   `value_compare` sees `ER_Term (T_Literal _)` against `ER_Num` and
   has no arm for that pair. Same root cause as (1), same fidelity to
   the F\* source, same divergence from §17.1.

Both would be fixed by promoting at the point of COMPARISON rather
than at variable lookup — a change to `value_compare`, worth making in
the F\* tree first (iron rule #1) rather than only in Lean.

## Next stages (in rough order of value)

1. ~~The expression language (`expr`, EBV, §17 operators) and with it
   real `Filter`/`LeftJoin` conditions.~~ **Landed** —
   `SPARQL/Expr.lean`, `ExprTheorems.lean`, `ExprTests.lean`. What it
   still lacks: a pure regex matcher (REGEX/REPLACE), pure hash
   functions (§17.4.3.16), xsd:dateTime TIMEZONE/TZ, aggregate
   evaluation over a group, xsd type-cast constructor functions, and
   RFC 3986 BASE resolution for `IRI()`.
2. N-Triples/N-Quads parsing + serialisation (round-trip theorems —
   the F\* tree's G4/M1 program has proofs worth re-proving natively).
3. A W3C-suite harness: build a small Lean executable that reads the
   same manifests `bin/w3c-runner` does, so the Lean engine's scores
   are measured by the same files (the F\* tree's iron rule #6).
4. Wider `GraphPattern`: GRAPH, VALUES, BIND, sub-SELECT, property
   paths, and the SPARQL 1.2-track LATERAL.
5. RDFS closure + soundness — the natural first deep theorem target;
   tableau work (#448-adjacent) after that, where Lean's structural
   induction is expected to shine.
